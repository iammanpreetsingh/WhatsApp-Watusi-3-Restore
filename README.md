### Sideloading (No Jailbreak)

1. (Option 1) Download the IPA file from here and sideload using your preferred method.

    The following IPA files have deleted the `Plugins` folder and include some fixes to avoid WhatsApp crashing when not signed with the proper entitlements.
    | Application | Bundle | Version | Watusi 3 | Stalky | OnlineNotify |
    | ------------------ |:---------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|

    | [WA Business][business] | net.whatsapp.WhatsAppSMB | 24.6.77 | 1.2.27 | 4.1.24 | 3.4.4 |

    `Stalky and OnlineNotify tweaks are disabled by default and can be enabled from inside Watusi Settings.`
