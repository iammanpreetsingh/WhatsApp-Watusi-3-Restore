The one and only way to restore official WhatsApp chats in Watusi!

The complete tutorial on restoring chats is provided [here](https://bit.ly/Watusi-Manpreet).


## Releases

This is an actively updated repository. Every release is tested and verified by many people, including myself. 
A new version of this IPA is released every time the [original developer of Watusi](https://github.com/FouadRaheb) updates the original tweak.

[Check the Latest Release](https://github.com/iammanpreetsingh/WhatsApp-Watusi-Restore/releases/latest)

### Sideloading (No Jailbreak)

1. (Option 1) Download the IPA file from here and sideload using your preferred method.

    The following IPA files have deleted the `Plugins` folder and include some fixes to avoid WhatsApp crashing when not signed with the proper entitlements.
    | Application | Bundle | Version | Watusi 3 | Stalky | OnlineNotify |
    | ------------------ |:---------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
    | [WhatsApp Original][original] | net.whatsapp.WhatsApp | 23.5.75 | 1.1.52 | 4.1.19 | 3.4.0 |
    | [WhatsApp Duplicate][duplicate] | com.fouadraheb.watusi | 23.5.75 | 1.1.52 | 4.1.19 | 3.4.0 |
    | [WA Business][business] | net.whatsapp.WhatsAppSMB | 23.5.75 | 1.1.52 | 4.1.19 | 3.4.0 |

    `Stalky and OnlineNotify tweaks are disabled by default and can be enabled from inside Watusi Settings.`
